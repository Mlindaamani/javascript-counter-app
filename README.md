This is a Javascript counter app.
This app focus on how you can listen ðŸ‘‚ to events using callback function and how to interact with the DOM.
I will be adding new features every week to make this app more robust by persisting the counter values evenif the browser is refreshed.

> [!NOTE]
> I will implement local storage in my app in the subsequent commits.
> Now the local storage is well implemented
